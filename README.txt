Simple but effective plugin for updating image alt text all at once.

== Description ==

This plugin loops through all images in the 'Media gallery' of a wordpress website and applys alt text based on keywords that you provide it. A keyword is selected at random from the ones provided, and one is applied as 'alternative text' to each image. Also works proactively for any new images added to the 'Media gallery'!
